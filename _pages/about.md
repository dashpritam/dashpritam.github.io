I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of British Columbia (UBC), where I'm working in the 
<a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/dependablesystemslab/">Dependable Systems Lab</a> with <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/">Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman</a> . 
I received my M.A.Sc degree from UBC in 2020 and my undergrad degree from Vellore Institute of Technology, India in 2016.
Before joining UBC, I worked as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/">IAIK</a>, Graz University of Technology. In that role
